# COST 2018 - Exercises

This repository provides code samples for the [COST Training School on Symmetric Cryptography and Blockchain](https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/events/cost-school-symmetric-cryptography-blockchain/).

This repository provides implementations of a simple substitution cipher and substitution permutation network (SPN) to demonstrate basic differential cryptanalysis.
